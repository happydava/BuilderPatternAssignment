Main aim: create objects of “Car” class with using Builder Pattern 
•	Class “Car” describes car properties (brand, model, year, mileage)
•	My methods step by step gives values
•	For class crating I used nested static class Car.Builder
•	Method “Build” collects final object Car and return it
•	Also, I created a method “toString” that clearly and structured displays info about my added cars
•	I tried to code with maximum “Clean code” principles
•	“Main” file - 19 lines
•	“Car” file – 49 lines

Result of my work: Program creates 2 Car objects (Toyota and Mercedes) and displays its characteristics in console with Builder Pattern design
